The code submitted for this homework is broken up into code for each problem.
In order to successfully run the code, copy over each problem code into a separate file and run individually.
Running the entire file at once will NOT work.
The code for each problem is similar to one another, as each problem builds upon the previous one.
The code should run without error and does not require extra packages.
The code for problem 1 prints out the final transformation matrix of the end effector with respect to base. A_1 through A_6 can also be printed if the lines of code are uncommented.
Problem 2 code prints out the Jacobian. Z_1 through Z-6 can also be printed if the lines of code are uncommented.
Problem 3 code returns four plots including two for the end effector position, one for x and z velocities vs time, and one for the theta values of the robot vs time.
