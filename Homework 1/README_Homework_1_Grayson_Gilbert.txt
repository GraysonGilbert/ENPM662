Homework 1

Problem 1:

Scenario 1 Initial Conditions:

x = 0
y = 0
theta = 0
wl = 2
wr = 1
duration = 25 seconds


Scenario 2 Initial Conditions:

x = 0
y = 0
theta = 0
wl = 1
wr = 2
duration = 25 seconds

This python script simulates two separate 2 wheeled differential drive robots moving in a circle. 
Scenario 1 moves in a clockwise rotation and Scenario 2 moves in a counter-clockwise rotation.
Both trajectories are then plotted on the same figure, and show the postion of the center point as it manuevers.
