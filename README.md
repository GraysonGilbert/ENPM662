Homework 1 Topics:
  -	Two-Wheeled Differential Drive Robot Modeling
  -	Forward and Inverse Velocity Kinematics of a planar RRR robot arm
Homework 2 Topics:
  -	Position Kinematics of 6-DOF UR3 robot from Universal Robots
  -	Velocity Kinematics of UR3
  -	Inverse Velocity Kinematics of UR3
  -	Simulate desired end effector trajectory given specific constraints
Homework 3 Topics:
  -	End effector force control
        o	Build on Homework 2, and perform the same trajectory, but this time apply a constant 5N of force to the end effector
  -	Assume quasi-static motion, and compensate for gravitational force acting on individual links of the manipulator
